      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

      <p>This is a game design document for the game “Puzzled Golf”, which is a simple 2D top-down game. This document is constructed to organize each component of the game. The game will deploy basic animation, tiled levels, collision detection, physics engine, and more other 2D gaming techniques.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>

      <p>The game is going to be developed through Phaser paired with typescript. It is going to be deployed on Firebase and version controlled with git on GitHub. All levels will be made with Tiled.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>BACK STORY</h3>

      <p>After failing to graduate college, you try to persuade your parents to let you pursue pro golf. Because your parents don’t really understand all the logistics behind pro golf, you decide to take up mini golf instead. On your way home from your last failed final, you see a poster advertising a puzzle solving mini golf game with gold stars and a tv show shooting to go along with it. You decide to take up this challenge and impress your parents with your wits and golf skills. See if you can solve these puzzles and win the gold stars!
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>

      <p>Clear all the levels with three stars, solving puzzles and trying to sink the golf ball in as little strokes as possible.</p>
      <br />

      <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>

      <p>The user will try to sink a golf ball into the designated hole of the level, by various puzzles along the way. Score will be calculated based on the amount of stroke required for the user to sink the ball.</p>
      <br />

      <h3>CONTROLS</h3>

      <p>The controls for this game will be both the mouse and keyboard when playing the game:</p>

        <li><strong>ESC</strong> - pressing ESC for the keyboard will bring up the In-Game Menu.</li>
        <li><strong>Holding Left Click</strong> on a golf ball will select the golf ball (highlight), allowing the user to drag back indicating how hard they want to hit the golf ball. Releasing will shoot the ball.</li>
        <li><strong>Mouse</strong> - Moving the mouse around while the golf ball is selected will allow the user to change the direction they want to hit the ball.</li>
        <li><strong>WASD</strong> - Move the viewport around the level</li>
        <li><strong>Right Click</strong> - Right clicking while the golf ball is selected will deselect the golf ball.</li>

      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>

      <p>All artwork in the game will be original. The following needs to be created:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Golf Ball</strong> - The golf ball will be a simple sprite, we will need to make artwork for the golf ball itself as well as animation for when the ball is hit, leaving a trail that disappears.</li>
        <li><strong>Floor and Wall Tiles</strong> - Floor and wall tiles will be used to contain the level the user is currently on and all the interactive tiles in the level.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Tiles</strong> - Interactive tiles will be tiles that have an effect on either the golf ball or the level and should each have it’s own animation:
        <ul>
          <li>Doors</li>
          <li>Water and Lava</li>
          <li>Switches</li>
          <li>Pressure plates</li>
          <li>Lasers</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Background Tiles</strong> - Tiles in the background will be used to display the current theme of the level, behind the ceiling and walls containing the interactable level.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />



      <h3>SOUND EFFECTS</h3>

      <p>Sounds must be made to coincide with each of the following events:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hitting the golf ball</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Hitting the wall</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Landing in a hole</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Landing in terrain</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Collision between balls</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Golf ball disintegrating</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Lasers</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Pressure plate</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Doors</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Completing the level</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h3>MUSIC</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Main menu music</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Theme track based off of each level.</strong></li>
      </ul>
